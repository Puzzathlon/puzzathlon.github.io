<h1 id="competition-outline">Competition Outline</h1>

<p>Each academic term a single question is decided upon by the <em>puzzathlon</em> committee and made available to competitors via our website. Questions will generally have a strong problem solving aspect and will always ask for some code as part of the solution. Competitors have the duration of the term to find a solution to the problem. The <em>puzzathlon</em> colloquium is held at the end of each term, giving competitors a chance to meet, present and discuss their work.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="solutions-guide">Solutions Guide</h1>

<p>Given the difficult nature of the problems, we encourage competitors to first attempt to solve simpler variants, classically, solutions to simpler variants might make assumptions like convexity, be in lower dimensions, or be for specific cases.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-does-a-solution-look-like">Q: What does a solution look like?</h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> A solution should include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - every problem has an algorithmic focus. An ideal solution will provide demonstrative code (in any practical language).</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong> - an informative discussion of the problem/solution, might include assumptions, pseudo-code, proofs, references to other works. As a general rule, it should assist the panel in their evaluation. A clear discussion will go a long way.</li>
<li><strong>Proofs</strong> - any associated proofs (as part of the discussion).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>

<p>Solutions should be submitted by the associated deadline. Next deadline: &mdash;.  Any solution that is not submitted by this time will not be considered for a prize, however it may still be discussed at the end of term colloquium.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-do-i-submit-a-solution">Q: How do I submit a solution?</h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> TO BE DECIDED</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>

<p>Each submission will be evaluated by our panel, only the best solutions will be considered for a prize</p>

<h2 id="q-what-criteria-are-used-for-evaluation">Q: What criteria are used for evaluation?</h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Criteria (in order):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Correctness:</strong> - does the solution actually solve the problem (or simplified variant).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Generality:</strong> - how general is the solution, does it cover all cases? What assumptions have been made? etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Novelty:</strong> - how novel is the solution, does it approach the problem in an interesting or unusual way?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> - is the code good quality, can it be easily run? does it demonstrate a working solution? is it efficient?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Visualisation:</strong> - are there any visualisations? are they informative?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h1>

<h3 id="group-work">Group Work</h3>

<p>Group work is permitted, in fact, it is encouraged. Credit will be shared based on contribution to the solution as decided by the group.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3>

<p>TO BE DECIDED</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="credit-and-referencing">Credit and Referencing</h3>

<p>Any works (or contribution) from outside an individual or group should be properly referenced in the discussion - give credit where credit is due.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="suggestions-and-feedback">Suggestions and Feedback</h3>

<p>We are always looking for new interesting problems that may be used in the future. Some problem guidelines are given below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unsolved</strong>: - a problem should be unsolved (or the solution should not be easily available).</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: - a problem (or its simpler variants) should be solvable with 2-3 months of part-time work by a strong undergraduate/postgraduate student.</li>
<li><strong>Computing</strong>: - a problem should be related to computing and will ideally have a practical aspect i.e. to write a program.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong>: - a problem should be easy to state and should be understood at a surface level by a broad audience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suggestions and feedback should be sent to the following email address:</p>

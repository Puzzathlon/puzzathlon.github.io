      <description>Problem statement: Given an arbitrary map consisting of a number of connected regions, find the shortest sequence of folds which ensures that every region overlaps every other region.
Definitions:  map - a map $M$ is a set of (non-overlapping) regions. region - a region $R$ is a finite continuous set of 2D points. fold - a fold is transformation that maps all points on one side of a given line to the other side, it can be thought of intuitively as a paper fold.</description>
